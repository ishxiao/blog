Thank you so much for your interest in my boyfriend  intern 2018 position. Unfortunately, I have decided not to move forward with you as a candidate at this time. I received an unprecedented amount of confessions, and we decide to continue the process with other candidates with a stronger match.

This is never an easy decision. I really do appreciate your interest and hope that you'll keep me in mind for the future. I will keep your love letter in file, and, however, look forward to reaching out to you with right positions.

In the meantime, we wish you a good luck with your girlfriend search. Thanks again for your interest in being my boyfriend.

Dear Sir,Thank you for expressing your interest in offering me a place as a girlfriend. However, due to the large amount of love confessions I received this year, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your confession at this time.

Please be aware that this rejection does not reflect any negative evaluation on your confession. This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of love confessions. With such a varied and promising result, it is impossible for me to accept all confessions, regardless of their outstanding confessing performances.

Again, I greatly appreciate your interest in loving me, and I offer my best wishes of success in your future love confession.

Best,
XXX

The only way to cope with the future is to leave nothing to be desired for the moment. As we cannot change the past and predict the future, we should cherish the present. Good fortune and misfortune in life are formed in every action now. To grasp the moment, is to grasp the secret of happiness. Just get rid of the past and future of perseverance, and make a comfortable living at the present. Itâ€™s the true meaning of life what you have actually acquired.

No matter what you face today, you have to believe yourself and be stronger than expected. The most beautiful scenery is your state of mind. The warmest sunshine is your vision. Sweep dust of eyes, and soothe heartache. Come on!
